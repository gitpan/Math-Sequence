Math::Sequence version 1.00
===========================

Math::Sequence defines a class for simple mathematic sequences with a
recursive definition such as "x_(n+1) = 1 / (x_n + 1)".

Math::Sequence uses Math::Symbolic to parse and modify the recursive
sequence definitions. That means you specify the sequence as a string
which is parsed by Math::Symbolic. Alternatively, you can pass the
constructor a Math::Symbolic tree directly.

Because Math::Sequence uses Math::Symbolic for its implementation, all
results will be Math::Symbolic objects which may contain other variables
than the sequence variable itself.

Each Math::Sequence object is an iterator to iterate over the elements
of the sequence starting at the first element (which was specified by
the starting element, the second argument to the new() constructor). It
offers facilities to cache all calculated elements and access any
element directly, though unless the element has been cached in a
previous calculation, this is just a shortcut for repeated use of the
iterator.
